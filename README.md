Take in a weighted graph as input, and analyse shortest routes

USAGE:

analyseren.py route_mappings.in route_requests.in


INPUT:

The first Input file is of the form:

	AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8, DE6, AD5, CE2, EB3, AE7

In this example, from node A to node B it is a distance of 5.  This is a directed graph, so a route from B to A need not exist or be equal to A to B.

Assumptions: 

	Node names can only be 1 letter, case sensitive.  Giving a maximum of 52 possible nodes (A-Za-z)

	Distances are measured in positive integers only


Second (REQUESTS) file format:

The second input file is the calculations asked to be done on the input.  Each line in the file is a requested calculation and can be of one of the following 
formats:

1.  A list of nodes, outlining a specific route.  example: "AED"
	
	A request for the length of this route, A to E to D.  If no such route exists, 'NO SUCH ROUTE'.  1st and last node can be the same

2.  A pair of nodes, asking for specifics about the possible routes between them.  After the pairing is listed, 
    then a set of characters to ask for something specific betweeen them:

	a.  '<noting>' asking for the length of the shortest route between the pair.  example: "AC" wants the shortest route from A to C

	b.  ' <number>s' - Asking for the number of routes with exactly N stops between them.  Example: "AC 4s" wants the number of routes between
		A and C with exactly 4 stops.

	c.  ' <number>d' - Asking for the number of routes with a maximum distance of N.  Example: "CC 30d" wants the number of routes from C to C less than
		or equal to 30.

	d.  ' <number>ms' - similar to case b), but the number is the maximum number of stops.

OUTPUT:

stdout	each item in the operations file is answered on one line

TEST:

python -m unittest -v test\Test*

VERSION HISTORY:

0.2 	- Added testing with unittest
0.2.1 	- expanded tests, strengthened method
0.3		- all tests completed for traingraph object methods - for the sake of brevity, testing is much less formal after this.  
					TestTrainGraph is thoroughly tested, all other testing is adhoc
0.3.1	- added analyseren.py, the main executable
0.4		- traingraph renamed to more generic graph object - lib.graph

DESIGN:

2 main parts, first iterate through the first file, generating a 2d array of distances between a pair of node according to the first input file.  Then
iterate through the second file, giving us the answers we want.

The graph is stored as a 2d list, but it is encapsulated in a object.  THen we have methods on the object to answer question 2b) 2c) and 2d)
